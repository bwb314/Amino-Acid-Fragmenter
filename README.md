Amino Acid Fragmenter 

This script aims to fragment protein systems for the purposes of
F-ISAPT Analysis. 



To use:
1) Open pdb in PyMOL
2) run aa_chopper.py in PyMOL (Note: this step can also be achieved opening the script and .pdb simultaneously, perhaps through aliasing)
3) Type 'chop'

This will produce:
1) A colored fragmentation scheme along with fragment names
2) A working input file with some sensible defaults
3) fsapt/fA.dat and fsapt/fB.dat files for post-analysis
